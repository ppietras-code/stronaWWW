    <p> Installation qualification, or IQ, is a documented verification process that the instrument or piece of equipment has been properly delivered, installed and configured according to standards set by the manufacturer or by an approved installation checklist.

Installation qualification requirements for equipment include checking for proper location, proper energy supply and acceptable environmental conditions. There is also checking of contents against the packing list, verifying software installation, documenting computer-controlled instrumentation, verifying connections with peripherals, and recording calibration and validation dates, among others. </p>
