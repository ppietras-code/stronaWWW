Operational qualification is the next step in quality assurance and involves testing the equipment and making sure it performs as specified, within operating ranges as listed by the manufacturer. All aspects of the equipment receive individual testing and the tester documents the proper operation of each.

Operational Qualification for equipment is necessary after installation, significant maintenance or modifications to the equipment, or as a feature of scheduled quality assurance testing. Operational qualification aspects that will be tested may include leveling and fluctuation, repeatability, keyboard controls, deviation reports, calibration and certificates, as well as performance reports.
